"""
Defines a class to manage file storage for the HBnB clone project.

This module implements the FileStorage class which serializes instances to a JSON file
and deserializes JSON file to instances. It supports operations such as adding new objects,
saving objects to a file, reloading objects from a file, and deleting objects.
